<h1>History Channel - The Invention of the Internet</h1>
<div class="b">
    <ul>
        <li>The internet has no boundaries, can be accessed by anyone, anywhere.</li>
        <li>Internet dates to the 1950â€™s and was envisioned by psychologist J.C.R. Licklider. He thought that computers would allow for communication.</li>
        <li>The Soviet advancement in computer science with tech like Sputnik triggered a technological race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Resulted in space race and the founding of NASA.</li>
        <li>Leonard Kleinrock applied queueing theory to data transmission which revealed the speed of a network. This knowledge allowed for effective resource allocation with demand access and distributed control. </li>
        <li>A concern for call security led to the idea of splitting data into packets and innovating the transportation of data. Data transfer would occur through many different stops along their route to the destination to allow for different backup routes. </li>
        <li>In 1966, computers were not able to communicate with each other but Rob Taylor of ARPA changed this later with one million dollars. He had the idea to have smaller minicomputers paired with each mainframe computer. </li>
        <li>The idea had many roadblocks such as how to know when packets arrive, defining a common language between computers, what if transferred data is too large, and many more questions and concerns. </li>
        <li>There were four connected computers at major universities in the United States in 1969. </li>
        <li>First major program on the connected computers was email. </li>
        <li>Networks were eventually universally connected in 1983 with Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)/Internet Protocol (IP).</li>
        <li>In 1992, Congress released the Internet out of the hands of the government and into the hands of the public. </li>
        <li>Although made public, the Internet was still very difficult to use because of the inefficient user interface.</li>
        <li>Mosaic was created in 1993 that allowed for easier access to the world wide web.</li>
