<h1>Dot Com Bubble</h1>
<div class="b">
    <ul>
        <li>The video starts off by talking about how the internet has forever changed the world. </li>
        <li>The video then goes on to talk about Amazon and eBay and how those companies were creating an ecommerce website for selling things online. </li>
        <li>These websites were blowing up in popularity and the creators were making lots of money every day. </li>
        <li>People on wall street were surprised how fast the internet was growing. </li>
        <li>The internet was a network growing like we’ve never seen before. </li>
        <li>In just 4 years when it went public it had 50 million users.  </li>
        <li>Moore's Law is a law that says that transistors double every 18 months. </li>
        <li>Another law is Metcalfe’s law. This law says every user that comes onto the network does not increase the networks value by +1 but much more. </li>
        <li>Metcalfe’s Law caused exponential growth in the number of users on the internet. </li>
        <li>Breakthrough technologies usually cause bubbles. </li>
        <li>Amazon was controversial to investors because some people did not think a bookstore can be profitable.  </li>
        <li>Websites like Amazon also had to get customers to trust them with their credit card info. </li>
        <li>Public key cryptography allowed for safe credit card info transfer. </li>
        <li>The private key is used to decrypt the data.  </li>
        <li>eBay IP0’d and they were worth $2B as they opened. </li>
        <li>Investors saw the success of eBay and Amazon and it made them invest into any dot com stock they can get their hands on. </li>
        <li>With companies like eBay and Amazon, many programmers moved to California in hopes of making their own companies or to work with the biggest. </li>
        <li>The success of tech companies brought about large waves of day traders and resulted in companies and people throwing their money into anything tech. </li>
        <li>Even though many tech companies were fundamentally unsound, many invested in them because of the fear of missing out on massive return. </li>
        <li>Telecommunication companies were laying fiber optic cables all over the country at an unsustainable rate without any concern for money or immediate returns. </li>
        <li>The Fed did nothing about the explosion in tech only until it was too late. They raised interest rates before the bubble burst, but it was not enough. </li>
        <li>The stock market plummeted 25% and with the terrorist attacks of 9/11, America was done inflating. </li>
        <li>Dot com boom was helpful for creating the internet infrastructure we have today and creating more stronger companies. </li>
