<h1>People Power</h1>
<div class="b">
    <p> As we all have known, humans are the one reason why the internet was form. Human beings have a lot of needs, but the most desirable one is the ability to communicate. Instead of feeling joy, happiness, or love, people want to express these feelings. The ability to exchange and share information with others is what separates us from wilds.</p>
    <p> In the past, the flow of information is control by the Big Shot. As Broadcasting and newspaper are firmly control by the higher up (company owner, etc.) to share information that they want to share. They not only decide what information you have but also the price. That is until the birth of the World Web. The creation of the World Web (Internet) not only creates startup companies like YouTube, Facebook, and Myspace, but they also stop the media from being control by anyone. Instead, the media is now being "shaped" by the entire world.</p>
    <p> YouTube founder Chad Hurley is one of these people who change the media. In the past, the television industry required three things, equipment, host, and cameramen. But the problem is the limited number of employees needed for the job. Only people working in the industries can share information with the world. Causing the limited amount of information an average-day person can get. Until YouTube was created, with their slogan: broadcast yourself, people could now create/share information whenever they want. Increase the pool of information a person can get.</p>
    <p> Another person who changes the media was Digg Founder Jay Adelson, who stop the news from being published by the corporation only.  News corporations in the past control what's on the paper. Digg change that format, and it's now up to the people who control what's make headline news. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive officer, knew the importance of communication, as Facebook is a site that allows people to communicate from anywhere around the world.  He also noticed that people care about what others think of them, especially close relatives, or friends. So, he made Facebook a site for people to share about their lively hood with the people they know. As a result, the creation of the Social Graph. Increase the growth of the World Web.</p>
    <p> People are what make the internet grow at a rapid rate. The amount of content and information on the Web was limitless. But that doesn't mean the history of the Web didn't have any controversy. The music industry files lawsuit against sites like YouTube and Napster for copyright issues since people can share other content without the owner's permission. But due to the share number of web users on the internet, the law can't stop everyone from sharing other content. Copyright is still a problem for the Web today.</p>
    <p> As time passed, a new era of the Web was born: Web 2.0.  As technology improves, the content and media improve with it, changing a static website to a dynamic one. Most new websites give people the ability to post for free, like Facebook, Craigslist, and Wikipedia. This ability is proof that the Web is own by the people.</p>
